For many businesses, winning a lawsuit and obtaining a money judgment feels like the end of a long and arduous journey. However, the reality is that a judgment is often just a piece of paper. It’s a legal declaration that you are owed money, but it doesn't automatically put cash in your bank account. The process of actually collecting that money is known as post-judgment enforcement, and it requires a proactive, strategic approach.

This guide provides Illinois businesses with an overview of the key tools and procedures available to enforce a judgment and recover what is rightfully yours.

### The First Step: The Citation to Discover Assets

Once a judgment is entered, the most powerful tool in a creditor's arsenal is the Citation to Discover Assets. This is a court-ordered summons that compels the judgment debtor (the person or entity that owes the money) to appear in court or at a deposition and provide detailed information about their finances under oath. The debtor must produce documents such as bank statements, tax returns, pay stubs, and property deeds.

A Citation also creates a lien on all of the debtor's non-exempt personal property. This means that from the moment the Citation is served, the creditor has a priority claim on that property over many other creditors.

The information gathered from a Citation is invaluable. It provides a roadmap to the debtor's assets, allowing you to strategically choose the most effective collection methods.

### Key Post-Judgment Collection Remedies in Illinois

Based on the information discovered, a judgment creditor can ask the court to order the seizure of various assets to satisfy the debt. Here are the most common methods:

#### 1. Wage Garnishment (Wage Deduction Order)

If the debtor is an individual who is employed, a wage garnishment is often the most reliable collection method. It requires the debtor's employer to withhold a portion of their earnings and pay it directly to the creditor.

In Illinois, the amount that can be garnished is limited by law. Generally, it is the lesser of:

*   15% of the debtor's gross weekly earnings.
*   The amount by which the debtor's weekly disposable earnings exceed 45 times the federal minimum hourly wage.

This provides a steady stream of payments until the judgment is satisfied.

#### 2. Non-Wage Garnishment (Bank Levy)

This powerful tool allows a creditor to seize funds held in the debtor's bank accounts. A garnishment summons is served on the bank where the debtor has an account. The bank is then legally obligated to freeze the account and turn over any non-exempt funds to the creditor, up to the amount of the judgment.

Identifying the debtor's bank is a primary goal of the Citation to Discover Assets. A successful bank levy can often satisfy a significant portion, or even all, of the judgment in a single stroke.

#### 3. Property Liens and Sheriff's Sale

If the debtor owns real estate, a creditor can place a judgment lien on the property. This is done by recording a memorandum of judgment with the Recorder of Deeds in the county where the property is located. The lien ensures that the creditor will be paid from the proceeds if the property is sold or refinanced.

In some cases, a creditor can force the sale of the debtor's property through a sheriff's sale. This is a more complex and costly process, but it can be an effective tool for collecting on large judgments, especially if the debtor has significant equity in real or personal property (such as valuable equipment or vehicles).

### The Importance of Acting Quickly

Time is of the essence in post-judgment collections. Judgments in Illinois are valid for seven years and can be revived for additional seven-year periods. However, the longer you wait, the more likely it is that the debtor's assets will disappear or that other creditors will establish priority claims.

Successfully navigating the post-judgment collection process requires diligence, legal knowledge, and persistence. An experienced creditors' rights attorney can help you leverage these tools effectively, from conducting a thorough asset investigation to executing garnishments and liens. By taking swift and strategic action, you can transform your court victory from a paper judgment into a tangible financial recovery.
