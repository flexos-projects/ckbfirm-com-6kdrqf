When your business is facing a dispute that could end up in court, the attorney you choose to represent you is one of the most critical decisions you will make. The Chicago legal market is vast, and not all litigators are created equal. Finding an attorney with the right experience, strategy, and approach for your specific situation can be the difference between a successful resolution and a costly, protracted battle.

To help you make an informed decision, here are five key questions you should ask any commercial litigation attorney before you hire them.

### 1. What is Your Specific Experience with Cases Like Mine?

"Commercial litigation" is a broad term that covers everything from simple breach of contract cases to complex multi-party disputes involving business torts or shareholder disagreements. It’s not enough for an attorney to say they are a "commercial litigator." You need to dig deeper.

Ask for specific examples of cases they have handled that are similar to yours in terms of:

*   **Subject Matter:** Have they litigated disputes in your industry? Do they understand the specific business context and terminology?
*   **Case Size and Complexity:** Have they handled cases with a similar amount in controversy or similar legal complexity?
*   **Opposing Counsel:** Are they familiar with the law firms and attorneys on the other side? Knowing the opponent's tendencies can be a strategic advantage.

An attorney with a proven track record in your specific type of dispute will be more efficient, effective, and able to anticipate challenges before they arise.

### 2. What is Your Proposed Strategy and What are the Potential Outcomes?

A good litigator doesn't just react; they strategize. During your initial consultation, the attorney should be able to provide a preliminary assessment of your case and outline a potential path forward. Ask them to explain:

*   **The Strengths and Weaknesses of Your Case:** A candid assessment is crucial. An attorney who only tells you what you want to hear may not be giving you the realistic advice you need.
*   **Their Strategic Approach:** Will they take an aggressive, trial-focused approach, or will they prioritize negotiation and alternative dispute resolution? Their strategy should align with your business goals.
*   **A Range of Potential Outcomes:** Litigation is never a sure thing. A trustworthy attorney will discuss the best-case, worst-case, and most likely scenarios, including the potential costs and timelines associated with each.

This conversation will not only give you a clearer picture of what to expect but will also reveal the attorney's strategic thinking and experience.

### 3. How Do You Communicate with Clients and What is Your Fee Structure?

Litigation can be a long and stressful process. Clear, consistent communication from your attorney is essential. You need to understand how they will keep you informed and who your primary point of contact will be. Ask:

*   **How often will I receive updates on my case?**
*   **Will I be communicating directly with you or with a paralegal or junior associate?**
*   **What is your preferred method of communication (email, phone)?**

Equally important is a transparent discussion about legal fees. Get a clear understanding of:

*   **Their Billing Rate:** Do they bill hourly? If so, what are the rates for different attorneys and paralegals who might work on your case?
*   **Retainers and Budgets:** Do they require an upfront retainer? Can they provide a budget or cost estimate for different phases of the litigation?
*   **Alternative Fee Arrangements:** Are they open to flat fees, blended rates, or other arrangements that might provide more cost predictability?

A detailed engagement letter that clearly outlines the scope of work and fee structure is a must.

### 4. Do You Have Trial Experience?

While the vast majority of commercial disputes (over 95%) settle before ever reaching a trial, the best settlements are often achieved when the other side knows your attorney is willing and able to take the case to court and win. An attorney's reputation as a credible trial threat provides significant leverage during negotiations.

Ask the attorney about their experience in the courtroom. How many cases have they tried to verdict? Are they comfortable and confident arguing before a judge and jury? Even if you hope to avoid a trial, hiring a litigator who is prepared for one is a powerful strategic move.

### 5. Why Should I Hire You or Your Firm Over Others?

This is a direct question that allows the attorney to summarize their unique value proposition. Their answer will tell you a lot about what they believe are their key strengths. Are they focused on their experience, their client service, their technological efficiency, or their aggressive approach?

Listen for an answer that aligns with your company's culture and what you value most in a legal partner. The relationship between a business and its litigation counsel is a partnership. Choosing the right partner is the first step toward achieving a successful outcome.

By asking these five questions, you can move beyond a surface-level evaluation and gain the insight needed to select a commercial litigation attorney in Chicago who is truly the right fit to protect your business.
